# Mission-to-Mars Challenge
### Overall summary
This work decpicts the request to have information scraped from different sources and placed into a new and exciting website.  The requirements included a way to showcase the work with BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images and the titles of four Mars's hemispheres.  Then storing that data into a Mongo database, while utilizing a web application to display the data.  The code was written in Python via both Jupyter Notebooks and VisualStudio.

Deliverables:
1. Scrape full-resolution Mars images and titles

2. Update the WebApp and showcase the images and titles

3. Add "Bootstrap 3" components to the site

Initially this would appear to be quite a challenge.  The expertise to execute this type of work takes time and patience.  It shouldn't matter if you have a Windows or Mac Operating system on your PC to conduct the work.  However, it seems that many of the challenges stemmed from the ability to troubleshoot errors that were encountered during the ability to use the required tools with my current PC.  However, most, if not all, issues have been overcome.  

I was able to successfully establish the outcome within Jupyter Notebooks.  The scraping was quite successful, and the images and titles were sourced easily.  However, within VisioStudio, I ran into many challenges with the different dependent packages clashing with my operating system.  Getting through that hurdle caused an unexpected delay so the delivery was not 100% met.

### Summary of challenge
In the end, I've spent a considerable amount of time (over 40 hours) to get through this challenge.  Unfortunately, the results are not exactly as required and need to move onto the next challenge so that I'm not too far behind.  I will prioritize the next upcoming project accordingly and come back to complete this in the next few weeks as this is 90% completed.  The only struggle was with Deliverable #2 in displaying the final images and titles.  The rest of the entire project has been completed.

### Lessons Learned
I've come to realize that striving for 100% completion is not the goal of this project.  Half of the time I've spent with this project was troubleshooting the multiple system and integration erros encountered with the multiple systems, dependencies, operating system errors.  I've learned so much, yet still have a way to go, in terms of building my technical capabilities.  I'm lucky to have a background as a Site Reliability Engineer and Systems Adminstrator so that I'm not fully unaware of the multiple issues that come up.  I approximate that with an additional 10-15 hours of effort, I will be able to complete this project.  However, as previously mentioned, I'd like to shift my efforts to completing other projects while placing this one on the back-burner for now.
